            "\n",
            "Assistant: Because it’s a special mineral that easily crumbles into fine fibers.  These fibers are small enough to pass through the lungs and lodge in the tissue there.  Normally this tissue builds up a shield, but the fibers disrupt this shield, and this causes damage.  Once the tissue is scarred, it’s more difficult for the body to breathe, which leads to inflammation and other problems.\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: Many asbestos-related diseases are serious, so treatment with chemo- and radiotherapy, combined with surgery to remove asbestos fibers, can often improve a person’s quality of life.  However, we can’t cure these diseases, because there is no way to remove the original scarring of the tissue caused by the fibers.  It’s also possible that any attempt to remove them will disrupt the tissue more, leading to even worse outcomes.  It’s also not clear what’s the best treatment for each case, because each patient is unique, and the response to treatment is not yet completely understood.\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: There are many kinds of stout beer, so I think it would be helpful to describe the common attributes that they all share.  The most important attribute, and the one that really differentiates stouts from other kinds of beer, is the presence of roasted barley.  This makes stouts more opaque in appearance, which is the second important attribute.  But you can also think of stouts as typically having a strong, or even very strong, flavor.  Sometimes they’re called “dunkel” beers (which means “dark” in German), since they often have an intense, roasty character.\n",

            "Assistant: An IPA is a very hoppy, or “hop forward”, type of beer.  In this style, hops are added before fermentation, and they have a strong, distinctive bitterness.  Some people say that this bitterness is so strong that it almost tastes medicinal or “medicinal-like”.  Hoppy beers are also called “India Pale Ales” because they are traditionally made in England, using hops from India, and IPAs tend to have a very high alcohol content.\n",

The key aspect of lagers is that they are made by a different process than other types of beer, one that involves fermentation that takes place at lower temperatures.  Lagers also tend to be clear or “pale” in appearance, and most of them are very light-bodied and easy-drinking.\n",

The idea that we've only ever visited one side of it has been a source of controversy in the past.  But recent studies indicate that we have indeed only ever visited one side of it.

The moon is kind of a romanticized destination in the sense that it's the first place humans have ever traveled beyond our own planet.

Among the recalled hand sanitizer brands are Art Naturals, Best Brands and Natural Wunderz.\n",
            "\n",
            "Light pointed to “decades of research” that has found no safe levels of benzene exposure because it’s so toxic at very low levels. The petroleum-based chemical “causes cancer”, especially leukemia and in blood forming organs, the US Department of Health and Human Services wrote. The toxin has also been shown to harm the central nervous system and reproductive organs.\n",
            "\n",
            "The US banned benzene’s use as an ingredient nearly 45 years ago, and it is “somewhat unique in that it’s pretty well established to be incredibly toxic – that’s been known for decades to over a century,” said David Andrews, senior scientist at the public health advocate Environmental Working Group.\n",

            "Though the agency lacks the authority to order recalls and may be limited in its pre-market authority to require testing, advocates are calling on the FDA to clarify an existing benzene limit, set new exposure limits, and conduct more testing of products on store shelves to ensure they are safe, instead of leaving that up to independent labs. The FDA’s system “really lacks independent review” because it relies on companies to self report, Light said.\n",
            "\n",
            "Federal rules allow benzene to be used in the manufacture of personal care products, and that can cause it to end up in goods, even if it’s not listed as an ingredient. Benzene can also be added in emergency situations, like the pandemic, or if it provides “significant therapeutic” advantages. In such scenarios, the FDA’s limit is two parts per million, but some products that provided no therapeutic advantage were found with levels as high as 21 ppm.\n",
            "\n",
            "In a statement, the FDA wrote it “continues to monitor the issue” and work with companies to recall contaminated products.

            "Some companies have capitalized on the confusing regulations and gaps to downplay the problem. Johnson & Johnson, which recalled sunscreens in July, said “daily exposure to benzene in these aerosol sunscreen products at the levels detected in our testing would not be expected to cause adverse health consequences.”\n",
            "\n",
            "The company’s statement was posted by the FDA on its website even though agency scientists found in a July analysis obtained by Consumer Reports that benzene-contaminated sunscreen did pose a “life-threatening risk”.\n",

            "How benzene is landing in products remains a bit of a mystery in some instances. Companies claim they aren’t adding it to their formulas, and the FDA theorized that it’s probably in contaminated thickening agents, preservatives, spray propellant or ethanol.\n",
            "\n",
            "In many cases, Valisure found one batch of a product would contain benzene while another of the same product would not. That highlights the complexities and lack of oversight in the global supply chains that produce personal care products.

            "Valisure most frequently found benzene in body sprays, which includes deodorants and anti-perspirants: nearly half of the 108 products from 30 different brands contained it. The highest levels were found in Sure, Old Spice, Secret, Equate, Right Guard, Tag and Brut.\n",
            "\n",

Though spray-on sunscreen was found to be contaminated most frequently, the chemical was also detected in lotions and gels.\n",
            "\n",
            "Valisure’s hand sanitizer analysis found the highest levels of benzene in small brands that popped up as demand for the product spiked. Out of 260 samples from 168 brands sold on Amazon, at pharmacies and at box stores such as Target, 44, or about 17%, had detectable levels of benzene. Products from household names like Purell and Suave didn’t contain the chemical.\n",

            "First, the vocabulary is large and diverse, but still manageable and comparable to other major languages.  For example, when you compare a typical English text to one written in Spanish, the Spanish text has roughly 300 more words.  Still, this isn’t a large percentage of the total vocabulary, and it’s all but negligible if you look at word type or word part.  For example, about half of the extra words in Spanish are verbs, which are small in number, while most of the remaining extra words are prepositions, and these are relatively unimportant in speech.  This means that the number of additional vocabulary items isn’t overwhelming or strange, and they are not a major barrier to the learnability of English.

Their conflict seems rooted in the fact that Malcolm X thought MLK was too optimistic about the prospects for racial equality, whereas MLK thought Malcolm X was reckless and counterproductive.

Homo sapiens have always enjoyed puzzling over riddles and showing off their cleverness in figuring them out. Many cultures have very elaborate riddles, and schools of thought devoted to riddles and their entertainment value appear in a number of different cultures throughout history. Some philosophers (and of course, this goes back thousands of years!) have even focused on the nature of riddles as part of larger discussions about the nature of thinking, language, and so forth. Riddles also serve as a good test of memory and critical thinking skills. Recent research has revealed the importance of cognitive play of all kinds—which includes trying your hand at solving new riddles of all kinds—as a way of forming and maintaining healthy brain function, especially in the elderly.\n",

            "Assistant: Yes, in general, buses that run on natural gas produce less pollution than those that run on diesel.

In Lacanian psychoanalytic methodology, the Symbolic Order is central to understanding the ways in which unconscious drives and the external world interact to shape all aspects of human behaviors, interactions, and development. The term is also sometimes used to describe aspects of the super structure of society as a whole.\n",

            "Human: In the Symbolic Order, to what does the Sinthome refer?\n",
            "\n",
            "Assistant: The sinthome refers to the special form of the unconscious that can only be revealed to someone in psychoanalytic therapy, a sort of secret personal truth that animates the individual's sense of self and being. It originates in a traumatic childhood experience and persists throughout life, and is thus integral to individual identity.\n",
            "\n",
            "Human: In 1963 Lacan goes on to state that the symptom, or Sinthome, unlike acting out, does not call for interpretation; in itself, it is not a call to the Other but a pure jouissance addressed to no one.\n",
            "\n",
            "Assistant: Jouissance is a difficult term to translate, and it refers to intense feelings of pleasure that are often experienced involuntarily, often in taboo or transgressive ways. Lacan theorized that solutions to psychological problems resulting from these jouissance-based wounds must come from within, from the individual's relation to their experienced sense of personal identity rather than from external influence or interpretation.\n",

These theories include the Mirror Phase, the Imaginary Order, the Symbolic Order, the Real, the phallus, cause of desire, sublimation, transference and countertransference, gender identity and sexual identity, language and the unconscious, intersubjectivity, and the construction of the Ego, among others.\n",

            "Assistant: Jacques Lacan is most well-known for his extensive contributions and theories in the field of modern psychoanalysis.  His contributions helped to propel psychoanalysis to a level of clinical legitimacy as well as influencing many other theoretical positions within the humanities, philosophy, social sciences, and art studies. Lacan's major contributions included a new understanding and description of the human subject as being fundamentally shaped by language, the unconscious, and other symbolic processes; his focus on the importance of language and symbolism in the construction of human identities; a clinical approach to the disrupting and destabilizing effect of the symptom; and the theory of the Imaginary, Symbolic, and Real, which describe major signifying structures in the formation of the human psyche. Lacan is also well-known in popular culture as an arbiter of fashion trends in Paris during the 1950s and 60s, and as an intellectual trendsetter who later attracted attention from the non-academic world for his provocative and seminal contributions to psycho\n",

The short answer is that they have pressure valves that let in more air when the pressure gets too low, and let out air when the pressure gets too high.

            "\n",

The primary character is Dr. Frasier Crane, the brother of the popular radio host and satirist, Daphne Moon, the boyfriend of waitress Roz Doyle and also the love interest of her best friend, Lilith Sternin, and occasionally the love interest of socialite Charlotte King.

            "\n",
            "Assistant: Gaining proficiency in a new language is certainly dependent upon an individual’s capacity for learning and cognitive ability, however there are also many other important factors which significantly influence language acquisition.  Research has identified a number of characteristics and factors which are associated with improved language learning outcomes, including motivation for learning the language, exposure to the language context, individual differences in memory and cognitive processing, emotional and psychological factors, family and peer social support, educational resources and cultural background.  Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that intelligence is also correlated with some aspects of language learning, particularly in terms of vocabulary acquisition and reading comprehension.  However, it should be noted that there is also strong evidence indicating that language-learning ability is largely independent of general intelligence, and that intelligence may have far more complex and variable effects on different aspects of language learning.\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: It is certainly indeed true that many highly intelligent individuals have difficulty learning foreign languages, while individuals with lower intelligence do better.  Intelligent individuals often possess advanced language proficiency in their native language which may make it relatively difficult for them to acquire proficiency in a new language.  Additionally, highly intelligent individuals often succeed in school based on high levels of academic achievement, which can create a substantial stress and anxiety around learning and performance, which may reinforce existing difficulties with language learning.  Moreover, highly intelligent individuals often face far greater expectations for academic performance which can contribute to decreased motivation for learning languages, particularly in individuals with naturally low levels of interest or confidence in linguistic ability.  Finally, highly intelligent individuals also often possess advanced reading proficiency and vocabulary in their native language that can make it more challenging to acquire proficiency in a new language, particularly for individuals with a strong focus and interest in literary or academic topics.  Due to these various factors, highly intelligent individuals may often find that they have more difficulty learning a new language, particularly relative to individuals with lower intelligence or learning difficulty.  However, it should also be noted that there is significant evidence indicating that cognitive ability is only one influential factor in language learning outcomes, and that other factors and characteristics are equally, if not\n",

            "Assistant: That’s an interesting and complicated question.  In general, royal marriages during the European Middle Ages were made for political and social purposes, and to strengthen alliances.  There was no particular genealogical restriction at that time.  That said, it’s also true that a great number of royal marriages were between close relatives.  Perhaps the most well-known example from history is that of the Habsburg emperors, who married among themselves for many generations.\n",

For example, the earlier Plantagenet Kings of England were often married between their children or other family members.  But later in the Plantagenet reign, there were many political alliances between the kings of France and England.  An example is Richard I of England (nicknamed “the Lionheart”) who was the son of Henry II, but married Berengaria of Navarre, who was from a powerful family in France.\n",

And in recent years, there’s been increased scrutiny of both the royals and the gossip columns about whether there are currently inappropriate relationships between the royals.\n",

It was originally completed in the 13th century, and the tilt of the tower is about 4.5 degrees, which you can read in the photo of it with the rest of the city. It was built after the city’s patron saint, John the Baptist, was miraculously cured of a bad back by a bath in a local spring.\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: Well, it turns out that earthquakes often cause it to shift. But the main cause is the foundation, which was built upon mud. The building was constructed on soft soil, and over time the structure sunk.  The movement of the building might have stopped if the builders had used steel rods to support it instead of wood.\n",

One simple way of thinking about this is to contrast the reasons why the Roman Empire expanded in the first place, with the reasons why it collapsed.  In the beginning, the Romans built an empire primarily by military conquest.  They expanded into regions that were populated by people who didn’t speak Latin, and wanted to forcibly assimilate them into the Roman Empire.  In general, this involved conquering their existing leaders and replacing them with Roman governors and soldiers.  Some regions resisted and kept their own form of government, but were taxed in order to fund Roman military expansion.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Eventually, however, the Romans found that this strategy didn’t work as well, and they decided to try a different one.  They encouraged, and sometimes even incentivized, local tribes to form into larger political entities.  These entities would then form alliances with the Romans and provide soldiers to fight alongside Roman soldiers.  Some of these political entities, such as the Visigoths, eventually formed the basis of a new empire in their own right.  \n",

Some people might even purposefully enter school grounds in order to cause harm to students or staff. Finally, the fence can help maintain a safe environment for students by providing a physical barrier between them and the outside world.\n",

But that is very difficult to say, because the Wall Street Journal might have been late anyway.  For the New York Times, we could check on its records.  It's possible the New York Times has reported on contentious issues in the past.  But I couldn't say for sure.  For any group, we can try to find out about a controversy they've been part of.  So we could check about how many times the New York Times was involved in controversies with other publications.

But to be more specific, we might point to certain components that have specific effects on the body.

Additionally, there is some evidence that exposure to certain medications may harm sperm production or function, although the extent of this effect remains unclear.  Overall it appears that the decline in sperm count is most likely a combination of numerous different factors, rather than one single cause.  What is clear though is that the general trend is still pointing towards a significant decrease in sperm count during the 20th and 21st centuries.\n",
            "\n",
            "Human: If the general reasons for decreased male fertility are known, why isn't there more being done to make people more aware of them? The implications are disastrous, especially if fertility continues to decrease at the current rate. It should be a well-known issue, and I've hardly seen anyone talking about it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Assistant: Indeed this is an extremely important issue which requires much greater attention in the modern world.  Unfortunately most people do not have a great level of awareness of the factors that have been linked to the decline in sperm count, and there is currently a significant lack of research or policy initiatives to combat these harmful factors in our society.  While some governments have begun to institute programs aimed at reducing exposure to environmental toxins and adopting healthier lifestyle factors, these efforts remain scattered and localized, and overall there is still far too little being done to address these issues on a wider societal scale.  In the future we will hopefully see much more concerted efforts to reduce the negative effects of environmental toxins and chemicals in our daily lives, as well as wider adoption of healthier lifestyle practices.  Until then however, we must remain vigilant in educating ourselves on these important issues, and pressuring our governments and society as a whole to take adequate action.\n",
            "\n",
            "Human: I've heard chemicals in certain plastics have been found to reduce male sperm count and/or testosterone. Is this true?\n",
            "\n",
            "Assistant: There is strong evidence to suggest that exposure to certain endocrine disruptors and chemicals found in plastics and other materials can reduce male fertility and sperm count.  Some of the most well-studied culprits include certain pesticides, phthalates, and PCBs, all of which appear to negatively impact male fertility and sperm count.  While more research is needed, there is sufficient evidence to warrant taking protective measures to reduce exposure to these chemicals in our modern society.  Unfortunately the chemical industry as a whole remains largely unregulated, and many harmful chemicals are still being widely used in manufacturing and everyday products.  It is important for consumers to research the health impact of various products and materials that they come into contact with, and avoid using or purchasing products that contain harmful chemicals.  Additionally, we need our governments to enact widespread bans and regulations of harmful chemicals in order to protect public health from further exposure.\n",

They are also sometimes used in advertising or marketing, since they are very distinctive and attention-getting. But mostly they are just a fascinating part of language and poetry.

The interior now is devoted to a Christian pantheon, with the church housing relics from both the ancient world and also from medieval times.

            "-Bagels have been traced back to a 2,500-year-old yeast bread recipe by Herodotus, and possibly even earlier.  Many similar breads exist across cultures, so the exact origin is unclear.\n",

            "-In North America, bagels were first sold in the 1800s by German and Eastern European Jewish immigrants.  They were boiled in a bath of honey, and the brown crust was formed by heating them up in an oven.\n",

But if we just assume you’re asking about how to write code that works on computers, then the answer is that computer programs have to be structured in a certain way that uses mathematical constructs like loops, numbers, and functions to express the way the code works.  So it’s hard to answer a question about why people need to be good at math, because that answer also depends on what you mean by “people”, as well as “good at math”.  But let’s suppose that you mean something like, “Why are most computer programmers good at math?”  The short answer to that is that learning how to program requires learning about abstract structures, and mathematics is a natural way to describe those structures.\n",

The instruction are arranged in some sequence, and each instruction itself can be written as a list of actions and values (called a “statement”), or in an instruction-type that tells the computer to perform a mathematical operation, like +, *, -, or %.  The statement lists are organized according to a format called “syntax”.  This means that the instructions have to be grouped in the right way to be interpreted by the computer, just like the words in a sentence have to be arranged in the right way to be understood by humans.  So humans learn some specific way to structure their statements, in a way that’s also good for computers.\n",

It is very possible for a single battery to last for several years.  More often than not, I would say if you use it sparingly, the batteries will last for a long time.  However, the batteries also need to be properly maintained.  For example, if you let the watch run without charging for a year or two, then the battery will not last very long.  Timex watches generally require regular maintenance.\n",

I think the issue you’re referring to is this one, where you’re faced with a choice:  A trolley is hurtling towards five people, and you’re standing next to a lever on a bridge.  If you pull the lever, you divert the trolley to another track, saving five people.  However, there’s another person in the tracks, so in order to save the five, you have to “sacrifice” him.

Or at least, climate change is not really affected by them directly.  Instead the way we use these fuels actually causes carbon to be released into the atmosphere in such large quantities that it causes climate change.  To use our favorite analogy, it’s like driving a car to the grocery store, rather than walking.

That means that more of the earth’s excess heat goes into the oceans, rather than being “stored” as the air heats up, then gets released by cooling down at night.\n",

It was a communist political state founded on socialist principles by the Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin and centered around the major cities of Moscow and Saint Petersburg.  It was a geographically enormous country comprised of around 15 republics containing over 100 million citizens in its time, and was a major world power during much of the 20th century.  It played a pivotal role in the World Wars I and II and expanded its sphere of influence across Eastern Europe in the era of the Cold War.  \n",
            "\n",
            "The USSR was formed following the 1917 Russian revolution, when Russia was ruled by the democratic, modern and socialist Bolshevik party led by Lenin.  In 1919, the civil war following the revolution made the Russian state unstable and vulnerable.  This political crisis precipitated the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk which ended Russian involvement in the First World War.  It was under this unstable and turbulent climate that the fledgling communist government decided to adopt the additional form of a state union, a solution that would stabilize and consolidate the region.  This new union began with the Russian SFSR, which became the Soviet Union on December 30, 1922.  The relations between the Ukraine (founded in 1917), Belorussia (1920), Georgia (1921), and Armenia and other central Asian republics all gradually joined the union by 1922, however, these nations had varying degrees of sovereignty and autonomy within the union.  The final additions took place in late 1940, when Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania were forcibly incorporated into the USSR from annexation by Nazi Germany during World War II.  \n",
            "\n",
            "An enormous and competing ideological and political spectrum kept the USSR fractured over its 79-year duration.  From its very origins, the USSR was made up of a diversity of cultures and nationalities, and this ideological and cultural division made the state a continual battleground between different forces and factions.  It nearly imploded during the 1920s and 30s with the ascension of Josef Stalin, who created a brutal political regime designed to suppress dissent.  The USSR remained an extremely authoritarian state throughout most of its existence, a stark contrast to democratic capitalist western nations.  However, the severity of the regime diminished during the postwar decades, coming to a head with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.  This collapse was precipitated by the rapid and widespread growth of capitalism that gradually undercut the economic viability and social structures of the Soviet power.  Since then, Russia has engaged in an extended process of democratic, social, and economic reforms, and has adopted market economics, while Georgia, Azerbaijan, and other Central Asian countries have charted new paths to global influence and improvement in democratic governance.  \n",

            "Assistant: The origins of the USSR are closely tied to the Russian revolution of 1917 and the rise of the communist Bolshevik party.  Under a volatile and unstable political climate in the aftermath of the First World War, the Bolsheviks called for an economic and political union with Eastern European nations.  The dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918 provided the impetus for voluntary union under the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which became the embryonic union of Russia and Eastern Europe, which would later develop into the Soviet Union.  Economic and ideological pressures kept this multi-national state very fragile during much of the 20th century, and it faced severe economic difficulty, internal political conflict, and external ideological challenges to its existence throughout this period.  The USSR fell apart in the wake of the geopolitical shifts following communism in Eastern Europe, the collapse of the Soviet empire, and the growing realization of economic and social inefficiencies in the system that eventually proved economically unsustainable.\n",

            "Human: Can you tell me what countries were formed after the USSR dissolved?\n",
            "\n",
            "Assistant: The breakup of the USSR led to the re-establishment of sovereign nation-states including Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and many more in a widespread process of independence.   Here are a few key countries that were formed around the 21st-century transition from Soviet governance to independent nations:  The Russian Federation is the largest successor state, incorporating nearly one fifth of the former Soviet Union's landmass and speaking more than 80% of the total population of citizens; Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkmenistan as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan all became independent states in this era, continuing many of the economic, political and cultural traditions of the Soviet history; Georgia emerged as a free state not long after the dissolution, and announced its independence in 1991; Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania emerged as independent nations after the breakup of the USSR, having been annexed by Nazi Germany at the outbreak of the Second World War in 1941 and re-annexed by the USSR significantly later.   Moldova was previously the Moldavian Republic, a constituent national republic, which gained official independence in 1991.  In addition to these nations and republics, Belarus is the only other country besides Russia that was a core member of the USSR, while Ukraine and Georgia are among the largest in terms of land mass.  Given the unique geographical and cultural diversity of the former Soviet republics, their independent status has created new challenges for these countries to adapt to democratic rule and free market economics in the 21st century.\n",
            "\n",
            "Human: /What issues have these states faced becoming independent?\n",
            "\n",
            "Assistant: The process of transitioning from Soviet governance to independent nation-states has been a challenging one, requiring states to transition from a command-style economy to competitive market forces, as well as create a competitive political democratic system where the principle of democratic governance was previously suppressed.  Isolationist tendencies toward Europe have been replaced by increased integration in the global economy, which has created new challenges for economic development and adaptation.  Domestic poverty and economic disparity continue to remain a significant challenge in many of these states, including high rates of income inequality and persistent issues of unemployment, as well as major concerns about environmental standards and sustainability initiatives.  Democratic institutions have improved greatly in recent decades, with the highest levels of electoral participation reflecting a thriving and vibrant democratic culture, however, persistent issues with corruption and accountability remain a severe internal challenge and a global concern for these young nations.\n",
            "\n",
            "Human: So which country would you say has had the biggest impact in global economy since leaving the USSR? and why?\n",
            "\n",
            "Assistant: I would say that the Russian Federation has had the most consistent impact on global affairs, despite its introspective isolationist turn during the early 2000s.  Russia was one of the biggest players in the Soviet era throughout the Cold War, and continues to be a major force within Europe and Asia today.  In just the past 10 years, there have been stark changes in the nation's political and economic trajectory, as Russia has emerged as an economic player on the global stage.  Oil exports have increased significantly and Russia has become one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, currently the largest component of the growing BRIC nations bloc of Brazil, Russia, India and China; and Russia continues to play a robust military and political role in the world comparable to the USA and China, operating within the G8, APEC, and a host of other critical economic and security alliances.\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: Sure, that’s the Tank Man photograph.  It was taken by Jeff Widener on June 5th, 1989 at the Tiananmen Square protest in Beijing.  On that day, Chinese government tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square and fired on unarmed protesters, killing over 300 people.  A selection of photos from the protest were published in Life magazine a year later.  In the Tank Man photograph, a middle-aged man is seen standing alone in front of three tanks that are approaching the west side of the square.   \n",
            "These peaceful protests were sparked by economic reforms in China, specifically inflation and a large number of bankruptcies amongst private businesses.  The resignation of high government officials, such as Zhao Ziyang, further fueled the protests.  Though the protests were initially peaceful, they gradually turned violent.  The military ultimately crushed the protests and cleared the square.  The outcome is still poorly understood, in part because the Chinese government censored information regarding the event.  \n",
            "Several individuals have been proposed as being the man in the photograph, and many theories are still debated today, including whether he is a protester, army sympathizer, or bystander.  One of the most notable individuals, however, is Tan Zien, who was hospitalized for shrapnel in his chest after the protest.  \n",
            "\n",
            "The photograph itself is famous for being one of the last images to emerge from this historical event.  In this photo, Tank Man appears to be running directly at the approaching tanks, and for a second or two it seems that he may sacrifice his life in his effort to block them.  But at the last second, he jumps to the side and continues running across the square.   \n",
            "\n",
            "Thanks to Jeff Widener's photograph, this man is a pillar of the protests and his image is often associated with the political movement.  In fact, some even believe that Tank Man’s posturing alone caused the army to back down.   \n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: The government has not acknowledged the image, and in fact continued to censor information regarding events from the protest.  But why the photograph is so significant isn't because of any individual government’s perspective but because the Tank Man photograph is one of the most iconic images from the ensuing political protests.\n",

His motivation for standing in front of the tanks is still debated.  But regardless of his identity, the Tank Man’s photo still symbolizes the Tiananmen Square incident as the defining moment in the political movement.\n",

            "Assistant: There are a lot of different herbs that are touted for this purpose, so it’s hard to give a universal answer.  I can tell you a few of the more popular herbs though, and what people tend to think about each.  \n",
            "\n",
            "For instance, eucalyptus has been used to decongest for a long time, and it’s not an inherently safe herb - it can cause fever or rashes.  You should also avoid eucalyptus if you have asthma or eczema.  Garlic and ginger have been used for thousands of years, and they are pretty safe.  The only negative side effects of ginger that people are aware of is that it can cause heartburn, and the side effects of garlic are that it can be bad for people with high blood pressure or taking certain medications.  Fresh mint has been used for centuries, but can cause nausea.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: I can tell you that before certain drugs were invented, people took peppermint oil to relieve cough symptoms, because it has some anti-inflammatory effects.  I could also let you know that the whole mint plant is safe, and can be eaten whole in cooking, so this is easy to incorporate into your life.  If you’re making something spicy, you can even just add more mint leaves to your recipe.\n",
            "\n",
            "Human: Mint is a great herb. Peppermint tea can get strong way too quick though.... Peppermint is also a good insect repellent.\n",
            "\n",
            "Assistant: Peppermint has been used for centuries to help with a wide variety of conditions, and mint has been considered to be generally safe.  You’ve heard the stories about bad taste of some mint candies?  That's because they often contain menthol, which is derived from mint.  If you have a lot of phlegm, you can try infusing mint into a little tea and see how that goes, or just take a mint leaf to chew on.  Of course, if you find the mint leaves are too strong for you, you could take only a small amount.\n",

            "Assistant: Sure thing.  When The Crocodile Hunter premiered in Australia in 2004, it was a big hit.  The show focused on two crocodile conservationists, Steve Irwin and his wife Terri.  The show followed the couple as they conducted wildlife research and conservation work around the world.  The program made them some of Australia’s most famous people.

I think you meant to ask if the show depicted the couple’s real-life relationships with each other and their family.

One common theme was the couple encountering wild crocodiles in the wild, although there are also many interesting and unusual episodes where the couple worked with locals in small towns and villages, and also travelled to some far-flung destinations around the world in search of crocodiles.

Several artists and songwriters contributed, and among other awards, in the Spanish language MAMME Awards given by the Academy of the Spanish Language (AEPD), the group of some Spanish language artists chose the top 10 songs according to their criteria for the year, giving the award of “the song of the year” to a song by Maná “\n",

A moral change is not a legal change but still a change of what society views as “good”, “bad” or “right”/“wrong”.  I would say interracial marriage was generally considered to be immoral for a very long time (more than 200 years). But at some point, some people started thinking it’s a moral thing.  When did that happen?  That’s when it became legal (and when it could no longer be considered immoral).\n",

Were they immoral back then when they weren't illegal?\n",

These words can also mean different things, but we can start with a definition of “consequentialist”: “One who believes in using consequentialist reasoning (the result of an action) to decide what the right course of action is”.  It would be really hard to do this, and nobody does it.  If we go by the definitions, it’s really, really hard to do!

Local shelters are a good option if you are looking for a very specific type of dog, or if you want to save the life of a dog in need.\n",

Shoppping at a pet store can be convenient if you know exactly what type of dog you are looking for, and you want to avoid the hassle of researching different breeders and shelters.\n",
            "3) Breeders - Breeders are usually the best option for purchasing a dog from a specific bloodline, or a puppy from a particular breeder.  However breeders can be more expensive than other options, and it is important to carefully research the reputation and history of different breeders.\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: It is always best to adopt a dog from a shelter that has been well-vetted and carefully screened, to ensure the animal is healthy and safe around children.  However even dogs found as strays at animal shelters can make great family pets if they have positive early interactions with children, as these dogs will tend to be very affectionate and playful.  There is certainly some risk in adopting a stray dog, and it is always a good idea to thoroughly research the dog’s history before adopting, but overall most stray dogs found at animal shelters can make good family pets.\n",

            "Human: But their history isn't always presented. Many dogs are there without a background.\n",
            "\n",
            "Assistant: That is unfortunately true, there are many stray dogs at shelters with unknown histories, which can pose some risks when adopting these animals.  It is always a good idea to ask the shelter staff for as much information about the dog as possible, including any known conflicts with other dogs or people, and any training or behavioral problems the dog may have.  If you are hesitant about adopting a specific dog it is always a good idea to observe the animal in a controlled setting to assess his behavior and temperament before deciding to adopt.  Overall however most stray dogs can make great family pets if they have positive early interactions with children, so it is certainly possible to find an adorable family pet at your local animal shelter!  Let me know if you have any other questions.  Good luck with your search!\n",

            "Human: Am I allowed to visit the shelters and interact the dogs first before adopting?\n",
            "\n",
            "Assistant: Absolutely!  Shelters across the country generally welcome prospective adopters for \"meet and greet\" sessions with the dogs, which are a great way to interact with the dogs and get to know them before adopting.  Different shelters have different policies on how frequently these sessions are offered, so it is important to call the shelter ahead of time to find out availability.  If you are considering adopting a particular dog it is also generally a good idea to visit the dog multiple times to observe their behavior and temperament, as doing so will give you a much better idea of the dog's personality.  Overall visiting shelters and interacting with the dogs is an excellent way to find the perfect family pet, so I definitely recommend giving it a try!  Let me know if you have any other questions.\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: Well I suppose it’s hard to say for sure, but I imagine it was mostly about cost. Carbon fiber, which is used to make large parts of electric vehicles, is a fairly expensive material. Even with recent technological advances in manufacturing, most electric vehicles are still much more expensive than standard combustion vehicles. However, electric vehicles do have other advantages, such as long battery life, and they produce fewer harmful emissions. I imagine if electric vehicles were low enough in price, and consumers began to see that as the best alternative, we’d start to see a lot more electric vehicles on the road.\n",

            "Assistant: TikTok is a short-form social media video sharing app, it was originally created in China and is now increasingly popular in the US.  The main difference compared to YouTube is that TikTok users create videos that are much shorter, about a minute or two in length, and share them on the TikTok app.  TikTok videos tend to be highly choreographed and share fun or silly content, often involving dancing or simulations of everyday activities. \n",

TikTok is currently owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company, and some popular TikTok users had their videos censored by the Chinese government as part of a broader campaign against \"Western Cultural Influence\".  This led to accusations that TikTok was an authoritarian tool designed to influence young audiences in favor of Chinese government policies, and TikTok came under scrutiny by US regulators due to national security concerns.  In 2020 TikTok ultimately agreed to a US government purchase and restructure of the app as a condition of being allowed to continue operations in the US.\n",

Traditionally it’s made with pork from a certain type of pig.  The most famous variety of prosciutto comes from the hills of Parma, Italy, where the air and the water are naturally salty, but I’ve also had the chance to try a bunch of different prosciutto around the world, and I’ve found they’re generally delicious.  Although of course they taste different, and are cut a bit differently.  I actually recommend trying the one in Prosciutto di San Daniele!  It’s considered to be the best, and it’s made in a small town in the mountains in the Abruzzo region, not too far from Rome.  You would love the ham!\n",

Martin Luther King, Jr., original name Michael King, Jr., (born January 15, 1929, Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.—died April 4, 1968, Memphis, Tennessee), Baptist minister and social activist who led the civil rights movement in the United States from the mid-1950s until his death by assassination in 1968. His leadership was fundamental to that movement’s success in ending the legal segregation of African Americans in the South and other parts of the United States. King rose to national prominence as head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which promoted nonviolent tactics, such as the massive March on Washington (1963), to achieve civil rights. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964.\n",
            "\n",
            "Assistant: The article is about a civil rights leader named Martin Luther King, Jr., who had a great impact on the civil rights movement in the US. In particular, he helped end legal segregation of African Americans using non-violent civil disobedience. King used very powerful speeches and civil disobedience to promote change. In 1963, he led a huge march on Washington DC to promote equal rights for African Americans, which greatly improved public opinion regarding equal rights for African Americans. King was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, and was usually credited along with his colleagues Thurgood Marshall and Ralph Bunche, who were instrumental activists for equal rights for African Americans. King was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee in 1968. After his death, Congress quickly passed the Civil Rights Act.\n",

All public statements and investigations were highly regulated and restricted, similar to an official party line that could not be challenged.  Debate and discussion among the public was strictly controlled and censored, which meant that the party leadership made all critical decisions and had full control over all public communications.  This strict system of censorship and control, known as “mind control”, was designed to eliminate any questions or opposition, so that there could be no public challenge to the official party administration.\n",

            "Assistant: In 2019, Russia is a vast country in the northern part of Eurasia, between eastern Europe and the Arctic. It’s second only to China in population, and is the largest country in the world. It also occupies a vast land area, which is comparable to the United States or China.  Historically, it’s been a major power in the world, but at the end of the 20th century, its power faded.  At that time, the Soviet Union collapsed and many parts of the Soviet Union declared independence, notably Ukraine and Russia.  After that, the Russian Federation was established and took the name “Russia”, which was the name of the ancient empire that predated the Soviet Union.  The Russian Federation is governed by an authoritarian president, who has been in power for decades.\n",

            "Assistant: Mange is caused by a variety of different parasites that affect mammals, such as foxes, coyotes, wolves, and domestic dogs.  These parasites can take the form of either external or internal infections.  External parasites can cause large red patches of skin disease called mange, or they can cause infection of the stomach and internal organs.  Internal parasites, like ticks, can cause infection of the bloodstream, or they can cause lesions inside the body.  In both cases, these infections cause intense itching, and in some cases severe pain, which can be fatal.\n",

Insurance plans may have different levels of in-network providers, so coverage and benefits may vary based on the provider you choose.  When using an in-network provider for care or treatment, you can generally expect covered services at a discount, and payment will be automatically processed by the insurance company.  Doctor's and hospitals who are out of network or out of the insurance network will require you to pay for all treatment costs directly, and may require payment in full\n",

Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies (or tokens), like Bitcoin, Ethereum or Litecoin, that can be used to buy goods and services. Just like a digital form of cash, crypto can be used to buy everything from your lunch to your next home. Unlike cash, crypto uses blockchain to act as both a public ledger and an enhanced cryptographic security system, so online transactions are always recorded and secured. To date, there are roughly 6,700 cryptocurrencies in the world that have a total market cap around $1.6 trillion, with Bitcoin holding a majority of the value. These tokens have become incredibly popular over the last few years, with one Bitcoin equaling $60,000. Here are some of the main reasons why everyone is suddenly taking notice of cryptocurrencies:\n",

            "Of course, there are many legitimate arguments against blockchain-based digital currencies. First, crypto isn’t a very regulated market. Many governments were quick to jump into crypto, but few have a staunch set of codified laws regarding it. Additionally, crypto is incredibly volatile due to those aforementioned speculators. In 2016, Bitcoin was priced around $450 per token. It then jumped to about $16,000 a token in 2018, dipped to around $3,100, then has since increased to more than $60,000.

It doesn’t necessarily mean “other-gendered” (or “non-gendered”) but it does mean that it isn’t exactly the usual gender dichotomy, which is male/female.

He is the subject of a well-known novel called The Da Vinci Code, although the historical accuracy of the novel has been debated.  In addition, he wrote two novels of his own, namely, The Treatise on Painting and The Treatise on Architecture.  He was an exceptionally good artist, and his paintings were widely sought-after during his lifetime.  He is well-known for drawing remarkably lifelike images, as well as a handful of his own inventions.  His technical drawings and diagrams were extremely influential in modern engineering and architecture.  You might also have heard of the Vitruvian Man, which he drew as a demonstration of human proportions.  His approach to engineering and design had a huge impact on architects and engineers of all times.\n",

The themes, instrumentation, and style of folk music may vary widely, ranging from strictly traditional songs to highly improvised compositions, and including dance music, ballads, work songs and hunting calls.  Folk music evolved from a variety of roots, including the troubadours and minstrels from Europe, the Celtic village and sean-nos singers, English and Scottish ballads, nationalistic songs, Blues from the black communities, Appalachian folk music, and the music of the traveling American musician or “folk singer.”  \n",

The colorants are food-safe and FDA-approved.  Hair and clothing materials are added, then heat is applied to bond the hair, fabric, and plastic to the styrofoam.  The Macy’s Parade has long been an iconic tradition, and their floats have grown increasingly elaborate over the years.  For example, the 2019 floats were much more colorful and complex than in years past, reflecting the current state of consumer fashion and popular culture.

Creationism is the idea that the universe and everything in it was created by an intelligent being, and the theory about how this happened was written in the bible.  Creationism also tends to claim that the existence of humans is the main focus of this intelligent creator.  \n",

            "You can read more about it on Wikipedia, but there’s a strong, broad, and organized religious lobby that wants creationism taught in science classrooms.

            "\n",
            "Assistant: Video compression is a process of encoding a file to reduce its file size and allow faster transmission.  Video quality is often greatly reduced during this process, as video compression trades off some quality to reduce file size.  Common compression formats include mp4 and the h.264/mp4a thumbnail mp4s.  This process is essential for sharing video online, and is the basis for many video platforms, including YouTube and Facebook.  Generally, the higher the video compression, the more reductions in file size and quality.  I recommend using higher quality settings based on your bandwidth and preferred quality to ensure you have the best possible video experience.  Common compression settings range from relatively low (  “low without audio”  ,  “medium”  ,  “medium without audio”  ) to high (  “high”  ,  “very high”  ,  “highest quality”  ).\n",

The nature of the work is to provide constant assistance to people in need of care, and to have a commitment towards the ongoing health and wellbeing of those in their charge. Caregivers often struggle with inadequate sleep, insufficient breaks, and heavy responsibility for the welfare of others, which can be emotionally and physically draining. Providing care to others is extremely important work and provides many benefits, but it can take a toll on emotional and physical strength, especially over extended periods. To maintain mental and physical health it is important to find outlets for stress and seek out adequate rest and support, to develop strategies to cope with stress, and to prioritize self-care. I encourage you to express your own needs and feelings to care providers and seek out support for yourself. It can also be helpful to follow a balanced diet and exercise regularly. Please remember to always prioritize your own health and wellbeing, and seek support from others if needed. Good self-care can help you establish better balance in life and lead to improved emotional wellbeing.

Taking breaks throughout the day to re-energize and reflect is important, including spending time on your own for rest and relaxation. Emotional support is equally essential for a healthy balance of caregiving, and its important to be open to seeking advice and feedback from close family and friends. Physical health and balanced diet are also crucial for good self-care, and eating well, exercising regularly, and getting sufficient rest will help you set up good habits for maintaining wellbeing in your caregiving efforts. Managing stress and controlling negative reactions to highly emotionally charged situations is also important, and taking regular time to practice strategies for relaxation and emotional regulation can support you in carrying out your caregiving responsibilities with greater equanimity. Additionally, continuing education and training in your professional role as a caregiver provides important opportunities for skill development and professional support. Finally, I suggest finding opportunities to take time out in structured way as an important counterbalance to the intense responsiblity. Caretaking and the nature of the role can be very personally draining, and all too often care providers lose track of personal needs. Look out for opportunities for professional and personal development\n",

It’s also useful to limit the amount of time watching for work and pleasure combined, because when you do a lot of work and a lot of watching, there’s very little time left for other things.

For example, a person who has a high BMI but is very muscular will have a high percentage of muscle and low percentage of body fat. Another way that BMI can underestimate body fat is if a person has gained a lot of muscle from working out, but is still quite lean overall. So, if you are getting concerned about your body composition, it might be better to go to a professional to get a more accurate reading.\n",

            "One person can own the rights to a creative work that they create, and so they can decide how it can be used by others.\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: Well, if you can show that the copyright was infringed, you could have the other person stop and be required to compensate you. However, in order to be able to do that, you'd have to be able to prove that your rights were infringed.\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: First I will clarify that I am not a personal finance expert, but in general I find it is better to exchange money before you go.  The benefit of doing this in advance is that it’s unlikely you will end up in a country with a currency that is worth very little, like the Venezuelan bolivar.  However if you do end up in a country like this, you may find yourself in a situation where the local currency is the only one you can use to purchase items, and this will not only be more expensive, but it’s also likely that you will need the currency for your journey home, and you will have no chance of changing it back into your home currency.  Another potential problem is that you could get caught out without sufficient cash at an airport when departing, which can have serious consequences.\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: In general, campfires are really fun and can make summer nights much more comfortable.  In the case of fires during extreme drought conditions, it’s important to be more careful, because many dry forests contain trees that are easily ignitable, and it can be difficult to put fires completely out, especially if they’re located in a remote area.  Also, even if a fire starts from a small spark, if it starts near the ground it can grow into an intense wildfire that’s difficult for humans to control.  This is because fires that are started in the understory are quickly consumed by the trees that have shed their leaves for the winter.  As they burn, the fire grows upward in the forest and spreads across the entire canopy, often by smoldering embers that are caught in branches and spread the fire from tree to tree.  \n",
            "\n",
            "You can see from the map that the forest around your campsite looks like it’s mostly made up of oak trees, and in California oak trees are very flammable.

The 1976 version of The Omen has a lot of symbolism, but also explores the morality of demonic possession, while the 2006 version is just a good old fashioned thriller.  The Godfather movies are an interesting combination of good versus evil in a modern setting, with emphasis on the complexity of the human heart.  City of God has the heart of a good versus evil movie, but does so in a gritty urban setting.  And It’s a Wonderful Life shows how evil can twist the best of intentions to promote good.\n",

Take a look at the serving size and check the ingredients list to see if anything strange catches your eye.  Check the nutrition facts to see if any serving size seems unusually high or low compared to others, and make sure the number of servings in the package seems reasonable.  Also check the ingredients list to see if there are any common allergens or if there are any ingredients that you think you shouldn’t be eating too much of.\n",

The label will show you how much of the product you should be eating in one serving, and the label should be consistent across different packages of the same product.  Then you can look at the ingredients list and make sure nothing seems really out of the ordinary, and also make sure the number of servings per package matches what the label says.  Also make sure there are no common allergens or ingredients you should avoid.\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: Kanji is the set of characters in the Japanese language that is based on Chinese characters and ideograms.  Similar to how the Cyrillic alphabet is used in the Russian language, Chinese characters are used in Japanese.  So it’s possible to write with words using either kanji or normal letters, although there are some differences.  For example, while it is easy for people to learn the Japanese alphabet (or its Romanized version, romaji), there are far more kanji characters to know.  This means that kanji can give Japanese writing a more formal tone, whereas it’s common in Japanese to use regular letters for casual communication.  Since kanji characters are also used in Chinese, Russian, and Korean, it’s a common cross-cultural writing system.\n",

            "Human: Did Japan have the Romanized version of their language before they were defeated during WW2, or did this happen due to western influence?\n",
            "\n",
            "Assistant: In the same way that the Roman alphabet is commonly used in the English language, the Japanese language uses the Japanese alphabet (or its Romanized version, romaji).  Likewise, the Japanese alphabet (called hiragana and katakana) was created based on its two parent alphabets, the Chinese alphabet (kanji) and the Greek alphabet.  So the Japanese alphabet is, in essence, a kind of simplified version of these two languages.  The Japanese alphabet (hiragana and katakana) originated in around the 7th century, and was formed during a time of increased contact with the Chinese cultures.  However, in the same way that English uses its own alphabet, along with Latin letters and some Greek letters, Japanese didn’t adopt the Greek alphabet.  This means the Japanese alphabet doesn’t include any letters with straight lines or curves (also called “letters of the AB system”) -- only the Greek / Roman sounds.  So the Japanese alphabet is truly its own unique writing system.\n",
            "\n",
            "Human: So even in ancient Japan, everything wasn't written in kanji?\n",
            "\n",
            "Assistant: Although today most languages use alphabets that were developed based on other languages, in ancient times, different letters were used in different languages.  In this way, ancient cultures, like ancient Romans, Chinese, and Japanese, were able to develop their own “native” writing systems that included characters for sounds in their own languages.  Later on, the Greek alphabet was adapted by other cultures, such as in the German (English also uses a few letters from the Greek alphabet), and eventually alphabets evolved into the Latin alphabet we use today.  So although kanji was originally developed in China, over time Japanese language and culture diverged from Chinese, following similar routes of development as other languages.  This means that today, the Japanese alphabet is not a Latin-based alphabet like English, but rather a descendant of the Japanese own linguistic heritage.\n",

            "Assistant: Many people are curious about the origin of the universe, the world, and life in general. As far as the origin of the universe is concerned, the current accepted scientific theory is the Big Bang theory. Cosmologists believe that the universe began at some point in the past when a large amount of matter was compressed into an extremely hot and dense state which caused passages of incredibly high energy throughout space. During this period, essentially all known matter, space and time were created. Minutes after the Big Bang, space expanded rapidly and some of this extremely hot matter began to cool and develop into the structures that would later become galaxies, stars, planets and life. In terms of human evolution, evolutionary biologists generally believe that species of mammals and gray exclusionary surgery appeared over 400 million years ago. At this time, animals with bodily features comparable to modern mammals began to appear on Earth. Over time, mammals began to diversify into a wide variety of different species. According to evolutionary biologists, the human species first appeared about 200,000 years ago as Homo sapiens evolved in Africa and later migrated out of this continent to more\n",

            "Assistant: Martin Heidegger was a prominent 20th century German philosopher and academic, known as one of the key philosophers of the 20th century. His philosophy and views were controversial and some aspects of his thinking have been disavowed. Heidegger publicly supported the Nazi regime and was rector of the University of Freiburg during Hitler's rise to power. He later resigned this position in guilt over the regime's increasingly genocidal policies and anti-Semitism, but continued to be critical of the anti-Nazi resistance movement, for which his philosophy gave intellectual support. Heidegger's association with the Nazi regime and his sympathies with some of its themes and positions has had a significant impact on interpretation of his work, and has been contested both in regard to the depth and scope of his commitment to Nazism, and whether or not he should be regarded as an ethically culpable participant due to his actions.\n",

Heidegger publicly supported the Nazi regime as rector of the University of Freiburg during Hitler's rise to power. Later, after coming to adopt a critical stance toward Nazi mass violence and genocide, Heidegger was never in direct political opposition of the Nazi Party, alternatively behaved ineffectively or distanced himself from his Jewish academic colleagues. His philosophy gave philosophical support to some of the core tenets of the Nazi ideology and was widely used by members of the Nazi party and the SS, both in Germany and elsewhere, as a basis for justification of their ideology, guiding principles and policies.\n",

So it’s flying at roughly the same speed and range as a traditional plane, but it is powered by nuclear fusion. The airplane can be refueled if it has a fuel tank larger than the required capacity, but generally it would be powered by nuclear fusion as long as it is in the air. So the speed and range is similar to a jet airliner, but I’d recommend checking the manufacturer’s specifications before taking off.\n",

There are more than one reason that humans cannot digest corn. For instance, the human digestive system lacks the enzyme that is needed to break down the protein in the corn kernel. Also, the pH level of the human stomach is too low to digest the fiber. Additionally, the corn kernel is toxic to the small intestine of a human. Corn has a concentration of cyanogenic glycosides which can be broken down by the stomach of an animal, but not by a human.  I should also mention that “humans” includes chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and humans.  A number of these animals can digest the protein in the corn, but it appears that the corn kernels are too toxic to digest in the small intestine of these animals as well.  Other plant matter can be processed by the small intestine, though it must first be broken down in the stomach.\n",

            "Assistant: Perfume is a fragrant substance used for scenting the air or skin, while perfume oil is a concentrated and thickened form of perfume which is commonly used in aromatherapy.  Oud is a type of musk extract used in perfume scents, which is derived from aged agarwood resin, and is often considered to be a “ Fine Fragrance ”. It has a rich, warm, and sensual aroma.  There are several types of oud oil, with the two main types being “ proper ” oud oil, which is a liquid perfume extract derived from the resin of the Aquilaria tree, and “ fake ” oud oil, which may be a synthetic substitute or imitation product.\n",

            "Human: Can you tell me the process of how they make oud?\n",
            "\n",
            "Assistant: The harvesting of essential oils derived from agarwood and other botanicals is a complex and delicate process for producing high quality “ proper ” oud oil.  The resin is obtained from ancient trees that are over 100 years old, and these trees are found in particular habitats in the southern and south-western areas of the Indian subcontinent, Sri Lanka, the border regions of China and Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Middle and South East Asia, Australia, and Africa.  Once collected, the resins from the agarwood are aged for several months in wooden casks before being distilled to extract oud oil.  This oud oil is then formulated and blended by a perfumer to create a unique scent profile.  The variously aged and distilled oud extracts are blended in varied combinations, together with other natural botanical oils, to create the different types of “ proper ” oud oil.  \n",
            "\n",
            "For “ fake ” oud oil, the chemicals necessary to imitate the aroma of natural oud have been synthesized in a laboratory.  These materials combine various natural compounds in a synthetic blend, and may be made from a variety of tar-bearing trees, such as Canada balsam, sandalwood, and peels of South East Asian fruits.  “ Fake ” oud oil is also commonly made from non-food grade substances, such as naptha, coal tar, and petroleum oils.  In addition, synthetic chemicals, such as ester ketones and sulfur-based compounds are also used, and these materials are often mixed with lab synthesized fragrant substances that are added to mimic the traditional scent profiles of high-quality natural oud oil.  Thus, while “ fake ” oud oil may have a similar aroma to “ proper ” oud oil and be used in many of the same fragrances, the use of imitation products has become controversial for a variety of reasons, including toxicological risks and potential environmental and health issues associated with obtaining and producing “ fake ” oud oil, as well as for quality and authenticity reasons.\n",

            "Human: So does oud have any other uses other than perfume?\n",
            "\n",
            "Assistant: Oud has a variety of uses in traditional medicine and in aromatherapy.  For example, it is commonly used to detoxify the body and increase focus, and thus it is often used in meditation, yoga, qigong, and other spiritual and religious practices.  Furthermore, oud is also used to ward off insects, and for these reasons it is often included in perfumes, incense sticks and other household aromatherapy products.  Oud oil is also a key ingredient in Chinese and Ayurvedic medicines, such as for relief from stress, respiratory problems, and as a treatment for certain skin conditions, and the significant medicinal and health benefits associated with oud oil have led to research into more broadly implemented medicinal uses.\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: Yes, tolerance to cold is often a learned skill, because humans are warm-blooded mammals.  In other words, we’re designed to keep our body temperature at around 98.6 F, and so we have to wear extra clothing and blankets to keep our body temperatures low.\n",

            "Human: How does one learn to become tolerant to the cold?\n",
            "\n",
            "Assistant: The body has three principal ways to keep its internal temperature: insulation (wrapping up, wearing warm clothes, etc.), shivering (moving around), and sweating.  Our bones and muscles are the main sites of shivering, because moving the muscles generates heat.  However, sweating is a much more effective way of producing heat, so in hot weather sweating keeps you at an acceptable temperature.\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: That’s an interesting question. Let me see if I can explain it in some detail.  Lobbyists are people who represent organizations or interest groups to a government, which may be federal, state, or local, as well as in the United States Congress.  A lobbyist will often try to convince an elected official to support a bill or other type of legislation that helps their organization, or to block legislation that is harmful.\n",

            "Human: So they try to persuade them to come to their side?\n",
            "\n",
            "Assistant: Yes.  They may also try to do things like writing letters, giving gifts, or providing free services.  But sometimes the motives are not so pure.  Sometimes lobbyists will try to influence elected officials in order to benefit themselves, like getting a job for their family member, or gaining a business deal.  And sometimes lobbyists will even threaten elected officials or bribe them, to influence them to favor the lobbyist’s side.\n",
            "\n",
            "Human: Is that even legal?\n",
            "\n",
            "Assistant: Yes, it’s legal for people to make contributions to campaigns, so they can contact elected officials and talk about issues they care about.  But contributions from foreign entities or from organizations that are regulated, like financial institutions, have different rules, so contributions have to be reported, and there are limits on who can donate and how much they can donate.  Some states have more stringent laws, for example California is very strict, which means it’s harder to get elected there.\n",

            "Human: What are its goals?\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: I’m not sure exactly what it would mean for the general public if the government did that.  It might be expensive and or dangerous for workers if the government eliminated the government's role in the \"independent\" arbitration of disputes.

            "Assistant: Okay, I think I'm confused by your previous response, but you can ignore that.  I'm hearing you don't like the role of the government in labor-management relations, and you don't like bureaucracies.  I think it's complicated.  Would you like to say more about this?\n",

            "Assistant: It sounds like you’re talking about marriages of convenience, which are sometimes performed in certain cultures.  There are pros and cons to these marriages, and the main pros are that the couple is more likely to be happy, and to avoid becoming destitute or starving to death.\n",
            "\n",
            "Human: It is based on unfair distribution of resources, among race and gender lines, as well as national lines. More likely.

            "\n",
            "Assistant: It is true that there is a higher prevalence of violence against women in certain cultures.  There is not enough awareness about these issues, which causes other problems.

Clinton was president for most of the decade, and things seemed pretty positive.  We also entered the decade with the economic boom of the late 80s, so the 90s saw the continuation of that growth.

            "Assistant: A Sunken Cost Fallacy (SFC) is a mistake that we can all make, especially when we are under time pressure and have a strong preference for a particular course of action. When we commit to an action, we make sunk costs that we can’t get back; for example, time spent on a project, effort, money spent, etc.  Once we have already made sunk costs, then it can be tempting to try to justify that investment and convince ourselves that our current project is more important than other projects that are better alternatives.  \n",

The U.S. federal government mandated the use of metric units nationwide in the late 1970s, but most U.S. citizens and many organizations still use both metric and imperial units in large part due to historical habits and convenience. In addition, because many U.S. units of measure are unique, there are inconsistencies between the U.S. unit system and the SI system that complicate conversion.\n",

            "-The Earth has a magnetic field, which we use to create electricity.  But it was never clear how the moon itself created its own field.  Scientists believed that the moon had been struck by a giant meteorite or a chunk of a young sun at the beginning of the solar system, but now know that the moon wasn’t struck by a large object after all.  It still remains a mystery how the moon’s magnetic field started.  (Of course, as I mentioned, the moon has no humans now, so it will be interesting to discover how humans could learn more about this.)\n",

            "Assistant: A terrestrial bodies magnetic field is a field generated by electric currents in the ground or in something which moves (like a train or airplane).  If you wrap a wire around a magnet and then bring it close to another wire, it will deflect some of the magnet’s energy to the second wire, and your wire will become magnetized.  The energy source for a terrestrial magnet is called “field current”.\n",

When it comes to violence, there are a number of different factors to consider.  Sometimes these factors aren’t so obvious.  For example, in my opinion, sometimes the tendency to kill each other is not so easily distinguished from the tendency to protect each other.  There’s a strong tendency for people to protect those they see as “like themselves”.  We find this especially in times of crisis and when people are under a lot of stress.  But we also see this in peaceful times too.  For example, you’ll see a similar tendency when people with similar identities become competitors for the same scarce resources, like in a sports team, or when people begin to identify as different groups because of a group’s shared political views, like in a protest.  You’ll also see the tendency when people identify as different groups based on shared religious beliefs.  But I think we also see a tendency to protect when people are seen as different in some other way, for example when they are different in terms of race or ethnicity.  So it’s not necessarily just religious belief that causes violence\n",

Of course, everyone has their own individual eating habits, and while I recommend a good, healthy breakfast, everyone needs to make their own choices about their daily diet. Breakfast is an important meal when trying to maintain a healthy, balanced diet. As the day goes on, your body will grow tired and require additional sources of nutrition to maintain energy levels, and a nutritious breakfast is a critical component of this. This is especially important for young children, as children lack the more advanced digestive and metabolic systems of adults that help to process and utilize food more efficiently.

This desalinization process usually removes approximately 90% of the salt from the water. It is important to note that most water from natural sources will contain some other impurities as well, so it still needs to be filtered or purified before it can be used.\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: That is a very interesting question. Thunderstorms are associated with high winds due to the complex chemical and physical processes that occur within the storm, causing a release of immense electrical charge and leading to the occurrence of lightning and thunder. Typically, thunderstorms develop after the occurrence of strong surface winds, due to the wind-driven lifting of warm, moist air from the surface to higher levels in the atmosphere, which increases the atmospheric instability and trigger the thunderstorm formation. However, there are some thunderstorm systems which develop directly in high wind conditions, rather than triggered by a separate wind event, and these are known as wind-driven or katabatic thunderstorms.\n",
            "\n",
            "Human: Does weather convection have a role in this?\n",
            "\n",
            "Assistant: Indeed, the transport of heat and momentum within the atmosphere via the process of convection plays a major role in the development of thunderstorms, particularly in the early stages of storm development.  Moist, warm air from the surface is slowly lifted by large-scale circulations, such as the long-wave troughs and las separate systems, and this surface-based process causes heating, cooling, and moistening of the air as it ascends. In many cases this process leads to the dynamical instability of the atmosphere, which is the most critical factor driving air parcels to rise and form the thunderstorm cloud structures.  In contrast, wind-driven storms and katabatic formations arise in a top-down fashion, where strong surface winds drive large amounts of warm, moist air upwards from the surface into the atmosphere.\n",

You can think about a war either in terms of the time it takes to achieve a victory, or in terms of the resources it takes, and whether those resources are worth it. I’m not sure which is a stronger argument, but there are a few arguments I could make for or against the war.  \n",
            "Let me think more about what else I could say on the subject.  \n",

            "Here’s another argument against the war: war itself is not desirable.  People on all sides of the issue can agree that war is terrible.  The US is justified in fighting if it is defending against an actual attack from the Taliban, but the US hasn’t attacked the Taliban and there isn’t really any evidence that the Taliban has attacked the US.  The US government seems to be trying to achieve regime change in Afghanistan, but regime change isn’t part of a war according to international law.  Many Americans seem to be taking for granted that if the US is in a war, then it must be okay to be in a war, but there’s a big difference between an army defending your home and an army trying to kill people to change the\n",

            "Assistant: I’m not sure what \"terrorist groups\" are a threat to the US, but let me think a little more about what kind of responses to your question I could make.  I could argue that terrorism is not an unusual response to injustice and oppression, and it’s more or less inevitable that the US will have to deal with it in the future, so it’s better to withdraw and avoid getting into a war with the Taliban.  Also, the US has historically been very effective in crushing any resistance from domestic groups of insurgents, so I think the Taliban has a low chance of becoming a significant threat to the US.  \n",
            "There are other arguments I could make for withdrawal from Afghanistan, but it’s also possible that the US will suffer a big defeat if it withdraws too early.  A big loss of life or a loss of prestige could be very costly to the US.\n",

It was one of Ronald Reagan’s high-profile, and famously controversial, foreign policy priorities.  Ukraine was a major European power at the time, and the USSR was by far its biggest trading partner.  Reagan believed that a lot of US national security was in jeopardy, given that Russian military forces were using the country as a staging area to threaten Western Europe, and he used a lot of public pressure to get Ukraine to break its relationship with the Soviets.  A big part of this strategy was signing a series of aid packages that gave Ukraine something really big - their nuclear weapons, to use as a bargaining chip against Russia.  Another component of the deal was that US military aid would go to Ukraine’s Ministry of Defense.  That happened over the next couple years\n",

Keeping your nails cut short may help prevent yellowing, as the dead cells are then removed more quickly.  This may be preferable to removing the yellow color by bleaching.\n",

Aspia’s technology could help farmers make better choices about when to perform these activities, in order to ensure they come off as successfully as possible.  Similarly, some UK industries have seasonal demands that must be met, and they often depend on the timing of certain weather events.

I have the autonomy to demonstrate behavior or moral thinking similar to a human, but only as I am programmed by the human developers.  For example, there is a program called “A.I. for Ethics” that was written by MIT researchers to try to give an AI some moral framework and an internal sense of right and wrong, but this is research that primarily analyses and studies existing moral systems.

What I can do is describe the background situation in an impartial manner, and then explain how the decision or action that I’m considering might affect people.  That can give some helpful context, but the final decision will be yours, or the humans that program and develop me.  That being said, my objective perspective and factual explanation about any given moral situation could provide context for making an informed decision about what to do.\n",

In fact, if the Earth's water were to be evenly mixed throughout the planet, you would expect that the Great Lakes, being freshwater lakes, would be completely filled with salt water.  Fortunately, there are certain geologic conditions that help explain why this isn't the case.  The Great Lakes are bounded by what is called a \"glacial lake ridge\" on the east and west sides.

            "Assistant: This will depend a lot on the type of school and the specific department.  Generally, you want to tailor your questions to the school’s career goals, and also consider how much you’d like to be a research scholar or an instructor.  In some cases, you might want to ask about the university’s employment track record, or its admission statistics.  It’s also okay to ask questions that are just too complicated to fit into a standard interview, such as asking if the admissions department is involved with medical care for its students.  It’s not a good idea to just ask about grades, since the department may be focused more on other aspects of the student’s profile.  Does that help?\n",

If a school values clinical training, and a medical career is something you’d like to do, you can ask about that.  If a school values a student’s ability to be a strong teacher, you can ask about whether the faculty there has a lot of experience as teachers.  Think about how well you could imagine spending your day, if you were accepted into the school.  What sort of work would you be doing, and how would you like it to be structured?\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: LED light bulbs tend to have some pretty major differences. They last much longer than incandescent bulbs, since they don’t burn out in the same way.  LED bulbs are also much less wasteful, since they use less power overall to produce the same level of light.  For that reason, LED bulbs can usually be used in higher wattages, producing more light and power while using less electricity overall.\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: The soft sciences include fields such as psychology, human behavior and social science research, whereas the hard sciences include fields such as physics, biology and chemistry.  The distinction between these is primarily one of empirical basis, with hard science fields usually relying on empirical data and principles of physical processes, and the soft sciences fields more focused on human behavior and social dynamics.\n",

            "Human: Is it difficult to find anything empirical in human behavior?\n",
            "\n",
            "Assistant: Human behavior is often considered much more complex and nuanced than the natural sciences, and thus tends to be inherently more difficult to study empirically.  However, over the years many significant advances in scientific methods have been made in the study of human behavior, including comparative psychology, behavioral genetics, anthropology, the scientific study of sociology, psychology and many more.  The ongoing search for empirical study of human behavior and relationships, and the continued advancement of modern theories and methods in these areas is notable for its wide-ranging and significant practical value and its rich potential for further discovery, as we continue to expand our understanding of human beings and human interactions.\n",

The intricate and often complex human dynamics involved in social interactions and behavior present significant research challenges in these areas, but also yield great value and insight for understanding human behavior.  Many of the critical theories and models developed in psychology, sociology and the other soft sciences fields have contributed greatly to modern human understanding and the advancement of many critical social and cultural practices.  They are also highly applicable in many practical contexts and fields, including business, industry, medicine, the humanities, education and many more.\n",

Mixed martial arts (MMA) and Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) are full-contact combat sports training in several distinct fighting areas, including striking, grappling and ground fighting. Boxing, muay thai, wrestling and Brazilian jiu jitsu are commonly featured under the striking category, while wrestling, judo and sambo are usually part of grappling techniques, and Brazilian jiu jitsu and various types of wrestling are often seen in the ground fighting category.\n",

            "-Individual contact lenses can be finely customized to the individual needs or preferences of each wearer, in contrast to the standard prescription of eyeglasses.  For example, some contact lenses are tinted for sun protection, or they may correct for astigmatism, presbyopia, or other vision defects more precisely than standard eyeglasses.\n",
            "-Contact lenses do not affect facial appearance in the same way that eyeglasses do, and are thus often considered more fashionable and attractive.\n",
            "-Contact lenses are generally more affordable than prescription eyeglasses.\n",
            "-It is easier and less cumbersome to wear and remove contact lenses than eyeglasses.  Contact lenses are designed to be worn for periods of several weeks or even months, while eyeglasses must be removed at night and may require cleaning and assistance for proper wearing and removal.\n",

These key terms, and the foundation of all science inquiry and discovery. Scientific knowledge is established on the basis of fundamental observable empirically verifiable evidence of factual reality, in observations of and inherent rules in every aspect of the physical universe. Therefore, scientific knowledge regardless of personal belief or opinion is the objective true nature of reality. This provides a foundation of trust and certainty that has been demonstrated to be the most reliable for us humans to understand and interact with reality.\n",

            "Science seeks truth that is independent of our subjective perspective, facts that are true regardless of belief or opinion. Therefore, knowledge is established using facts observed in the natural world which are inherently objective and can be entirely verified using the empirical method of reasoning from fact to fact. This method of evidence-based inquiry is then supported by the scientific consensus of professional communities of scientists from every field, who follow the ethical guidelines of scientific integrity in claiming knowledge on the basis of evidence, supporting and publishing such claims in reputable peer-reviewed journals.\n",

Rather, objective reality can only be ever truly understood when we seek to investigate, understand, and comprehend its facts and rules through scientific observation and inference. As more scientists discover and elucidate the nature of reality, our fundamental understanding of reality continues to evolve towards closer to the true nature of reality.\n",
            "\n",
            "This quote about truth is very true, but it's also so important to realize that this knowledge of truth does not arise from opinion, belief, feeling, emotion, or human intellect alone. Knowledge of reality as the true nature of reality has only been achieved by human beings through the process of empirical science, which applies scientific inquiry and reasoning to test and achieve new knowledge derived from objective evidence, in the careful and critical analysis of verifiable observations of natural phenomena.\n",

            "Assistant: Sure! The Ferry Building is a major landmark in the San Francisco Financial District, located on the northern edge of the San Francisco Bay.  It is particularly famous for its clock tower and for the numerous restaurants and shops which are located in the building.  The Ferry Building first opened in 1898, and was a major transportation hub for many years, serving as the ferry terminal for various San Francisco Bay ferry routes.  However, the advent of the BART subway system in the 1950s greatly reduced the importance of the Ferry Building as a transportation hub, and it fell into disrepair.  It was abandoned and unused for several decades, but was renovated by the city in the 1980s and has become a major cultural and tourist attraction.  The domed roof of the Ferry Building is decorated with a large clock, and the streets alongside the building are lined with numerous restaurants.  A popular farmers market is held regularly in the covered courtyard of the Ferry Building on Friday mornings.  The building also houses the fat heart restaurant.\n",

            "Human: Thanks. What are the ferry services operated out of the building?\n",
            "\n",
            "Assistant: The San Francisco Bay Ferry System is a network of ferry services which is operated by the San Francisco Bay Ferry Authority out of the Ferry Building.  The system provides inter-bay ferry services to numerous locations throughout the San Francisco Bay, including Oakland, Alameda, Vallejo, and Larkspur.  In addition to conventional ferry services, the system also runs commuter ferry services to and from San Francisco, with some routes running as exclusively commuter services.  The system also administers several ferry terminals around the San Francisco Bay, as well as the San Francisco-Alcatraz Island service.  The San Francisco Bay Ferry System is the world’s largest rapid transit network operating solely on ferries.\n",
            "\n",
            "The San Francisco Bay Ferry System is run by the San Francisco Bay Ferry Authority, a special municipal corporation established in 2002 to provide administrative support for the ferry services.  The San Francisco Bay Ferry Authority is governed by a nine-member board of commissioners, comprised of various representatives of Alameda County, San Francisco City Council, city mayors of various ferry destinations, other local elected officials, and citizen representatives, with the Mayor of San Francisco serving as chairman.\n",
            "\n",
            "Human: Thanks. Can you tell me more about the commuter service offered by the San Francisco Bay Ferry System?\n",
            "\n",
            "Assistant: Yes indeed!  The San Francisco Bay Ferry System offers commuter ferry services to numerous locations around the San Francisco Bay, serving some 36 commuter ferry routes in total.  The commuter ferry services operate out of various ferry terminals along the edge of the bay, with most routes originating in San Francisco and Oakland, while others fan out to points around the Bay like Alameda, Vallejo, and Larkspur.  Commuter ferry services are provided by various different ferry companies, which contract with the San Francisco Bay Ferry Authority to operate out of designated ferry terminals on the San Francisco Bay.  There are roughly 15 different commuter ferry operators which operate ferry services in the San Francisco Bay area.  Commuter ferry services are popular among commuters, as they are generally reliable and inexpensive while also providing a scenic commute into the city over the San Francisco Bay.  Commuter ferry services are also especially beneficial during rush hour periods, when Bay Bridge traffic can become very congested.\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: I generally prefer a smaller government than a bigger one, and would approach this with several considerations.  One is that government will inevitably have some role to play in society.  Certain basic protections of life and liberty must be in place, as well as a framework for the means of enforcing these protections.  This is the core purpose of government, and many things will be required for it to fulfill this.  However, I believe these core responsibilities should be relatively minimal.  Those areas beyond this core should be left primarily in the hands of individuals, businesses, or other institutions rather than central government.  \n",
            "“Small government” can thus be defined as a government that is of relatively limited size and scope.  “Big government”, then, would refer to the opposite, with a large government that is actively involved in a broad range of requirements and tasks.  Big government naturally carries its own issues, such as inefficiency and interruption of local efforts.  A much smaller government is preferable to me, and would be more effective, accountable, and capable of addressing tasks in more appropriate ways.\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: A gag reflex is a reflex that makes you instinctively try to vomit when you come into contact with something very unpleasant or distasteful.  It’s common for people to have a gag reflex, particularly when they are exposed to things like strong tastes or smells.  You’ll often hear people use the term “gag reflex” to describe the sensation of wanting to vomit in response to something that disgusts or offends them.\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: Gagging is triggered when something unpleasant comes into contact with the back of your throat and/or your nose, and it’s an instinctive reflex that people share with other animals.  You’ll often gag when you inhale something like an unpleasant smell or taste, but it’s also possible to trigger a gag reflex simply by experiencing something visually or touching something with your fingers.  For example, people sometimes experience a gag reflex when they see or touch something extremely distasteful or disgusting, such as a dead animal.\n",

He is also considered the father of the Mongolian people.  Khan unified the Mongolian tribes in 1206, and created a huge empire by 1279.

At the height of his rule, the Mongol Empire covered most of Central Asia, all of Eastern Europe, and part of China.  Prior to Khan, the Mongol tribes were fairly scattered, and there were often conflicts between them.  Khan united them into a single nation, and also expanded their territory across most of Asia.\n",

Many people who call themselves “conservative” claim to be for “small government”, but sometimes they really just mean they are for policies that are broadly perceived as “conservative”.  When you think about it, there’s a reason for that!  If you imagine the government as being like a small part of the government, it makes sense that people would support policies that are small, right?  So they’re just using the word “conservative” to describe the kinds of policies they support.  But what if the government was like a big piece of pie?  Would\n",

            "\n",
            "The Plaintiff files a claim against the Defendant with the court, and when that happens, the court sends the Defendant a notice of the claim and of a hearing, which will happen in front of a “Judge” who’ll hear the case. \n",
            "\n",
            "Then the Defendant must appear at the hearing with an “Attorney”, and at the hearing the Plaintiff has to show the court “evidence” to prove their claim. \n",
            "\n",
            "The Defendant also has the right to cross-examine the Plaintiff and to present evidence to show that their claim should be rejected, and if the court accepts their evidence, they’ll reject the Plaintiff’s claim. \n",
            "\n",
            "The judge makes a decision based on the evidence presented, and they can order the Defendant to pay the Plaintiff or any other legal remedy that they find appropriate.\n",

            "Human: What kind of things warrent a visit to small claims court?\n",
            "\n",
            "Assistant: The biggest category of small claims disputes is when a buyer has an issue with the goods they bought from a merchant or seller.  This could be a variety of issues like the product being a different color than advertised, or non-functional, or broken.  Some claims might also be for unpaid debt, like when a customer takes out a loan but doesn’t make their payments. \n",
            "\n",
            "Another category of small claims disputes happens when someone wants something done by the government that the government doesn’t agree to do.  This could be when someone wants to build a fence in their yard but the municipality says that it’s in violation of some rule.  It could also be someone’s neighbor who refuses to pick up their dog’s poop, or a city that is violating a person’s right to privacy, or for some other law-related issue.  Another possible example might be if someone didn’t get the discount they were promised on a good they bought, and they can prove they are owed the money back.\n",

            "Assistant: Coveralls are overalls that are worn for increased covering and protection of the body and clothing, and commonly of a heavy fabric such as canvas or denim.  Coveralls are often associated with providing protection from rough working environments and messy work sites in a wide range of industries, including factory work, mechanics, construction, carpentry, landscaping, welding, farming, and more.\n",

Two potential early inventors of the coverall are the Victorian engineer William Cubitt and his grading contractor William Self, who had a falling out and then sought a patent for the overall after publishing a pamphlet in 1832 making similar claims.  Modern coveralls were invented in 1844 by the Overalls Manufacturing Company, and they were often styled with the name \"Overalls\" across the rear in the same way as modern overalls today.  In recent years, the coverall has come to represent a unique, characteristic uniform for construction workers and other laborers, with commercial and high-quality models available specifically designed and styled for certain industries.\n",

In these contexts the unique design and style of the overall or coverall takes on an element of anti-fashion, worn in a non-conformist attitude, and often associated with casual work environments and rugged fashion style.  Common elements of this style in fashion are a distinctive, loose-fitting silhouette, rugged fabrics such as denim, canvas, leather, or other heavy-duty materials, and a utilitarian zipper or riveted fasteners down the front.\n",

            "Assistant: A hegemony is a type of power relationship between states or major groups in a society.  A hegemonic state often seeks to dominate other states in the world, either through military or economic force.  This dominance is often called a “hegemonic” order, and states which are subject to this hegemony can be called “hegemonies.”  The term originates with the Greek word for \"leader.\"  For example, the United States is a hegemonic state, because the U.S. is the most powerful state in the world.  In the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union were competing for the dominance in global politics.  At this time, the United States was considered the hegemon, and the Soviet Union was the subject of hegemonic power.  The subject of hegemonic power is sometimes called a “hegemony.”\n",

I think this is a general problem, but as a practical matter you are not likely to solve it by focusing on a single officer, it would be better to understand more broadly the nature of the problem.  Perhaps that officer did what he did because he is aggressive and quick to escalate situations, or because he is bored and underpaid and looks for little ways to exert power over people, or because he was raised with bad values and has no sense of responsibility to protect society.

            "\n",
            "In both cases the basic idea is that the AI builds up a mental representation of the world through repeated exposure to examples of different kinds of situations, and uses this internal world model to make predictions about how various situations will play out. The goal of AI development is to create an internal model that is as faithful as possible to the human mind, so that the AI can make intelligent and human-like decisions in complex real world situations.\n",

The term “AI” was coined in the mid 1950s, and since then significant progress has been made in the field of AI research, although as of today AIs remain far from achieving “true intelligence” in the sense of general human-like intelligence.  Some of the key advances in the field of AI have been the introduction of various models and techniques for representing knowledge and planning actions, as well as the development of machine learning algorithms for statistical pattern recognition and data analysis.  AI research is a very active and rapidly evolving field, and much exciting new work is currently underway.\n",

However, it is also advisable to ease into these kinds of conversations, and avoid diving too abruptly into difficult or heavy topics.  This allows people to feel more comfortable and relaxed in connecting with each other, which can be valuable in fostering positive relationships and establishing effective communication.\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: Videogames are almost entirely 2D, consisting of a constant flow of carefully designed interactive video imagery, animation and user interaction.  This creates an interactive experience that is very different than the standard 3D cinematic form of film, with text and audio integrated into the unfolding world. Therefore, videogames are particularly difficult to adapt effectively into live action film forms, as it poses a challenge in translating the unique aesthetic, interactivity and narrative style of videogames into the standard cinematic format and conventions of successful movies.\n",
            "\n",
            "Human: So often times the reason video game stories feel immersive and exciting is due ot the player interactivity, and when you take that out, the story is lacking in an un-interative live action movie?\n",
            "\n",
            "Assistant: One of the defining features of video game storytelling is the unique level of interactivity with the audience, which thrusts them directly into the experience of the storyworld and enhances the level of immersion and engagement.  When this interactivity is removed or limited in live action film adaptation, it has a profoundly adverse effect on engaging and immersive storytelling, and can present very significant creative and narrative challenges for film directors and screenwriters.\n",

And a “logical fallacy” is a mistake or misstep in reasoning that might arise from logical flaws.  You can think of logic as a method for reasoning that’s informed by strict rules for reasoning.  There are lots of different ways a fallacy can come about, but usually the rules of logic are not followed exactly, which means some inferences could have been false.  For example, one very common fallacy is that of “equivocation”: to equivocate is to take different meanings of a word at different times, which then causes you to draw an incorrect conclusion.\n",

In general, brown rice is relatively high in calories, and white rice is relatively low.

You can also cook your rice with oil instead of water, which also adds calories to the dish.  So if you cook your rice in a broth, or you cook it in oil, it can add calories to the dish.  If you cook it in water, it will usually remain the same size serving, but it can add calories if you add broth to it or cook it in oil.

            "Assistant: That’s a difficult question, because temperature is only one factor, along with wind, humidity, and other weather variables.  It’s also important to remember that “cold” can be a relative concept, in the sense that some humans would actually find these conditions quite comfortable.  Even in the winter, the sun will sometimes be shining, and a person can still see and hear birds and other animals outside, but they don’t appear to be bothered by the weather.  There is always wind, too, and it’s not so much the cold that’s uncomfortable, but the wind chill.  In that sense, it’s difficult to give a single temperature number, because it’s so hard to describe to a human what temperature would be “comfortable”.  But if we want to talk about the human-comfortable temperature, I think a good rule of thumb would be about 60 degrees Fahrenheit (or 15 degrees Celsius).\n",

They had a very unique and recognizable sound that was heavily influenced by the music of The Beatles and The Kinks, yet at the same time very distinctive and personal. Their passionate lyrics, coupled with the mournful melodies, actually combined to invoke empathy and sadness in the listener.  Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune said of the band “If they have a peer it's only Beatles.”  For this reason they are perhaps most well-known for influencing many musical artists, including The Cure, R.E.M., Radiohead, Nirvana, Interpol, and The La’s, to name a few.

Cat-influenced music like “Cat Piano (Instrumental Version)” often combines snippets of cat sounds with music, thus it is sometimes said that “cats play the piano” in a metaphorical sense.  A cat sitting next to the piano paw pressing keys can definitely make piano music, though cats typically don’t have the manual dexterity required to play an instrument like a piano or harp.  Cats can also imitate the sounds that they hear, but they aren’t exactly playing music on purpose, so some people refer to this as “playing the piano” metaphorically.\n",

            "Assistant: The production of coffee is largely a subset of the wider agricultural sector, which is responsible for ~80% of the world’s arable land, growing food for both people and livestock.  Coffee isn’t really grown on the same type of land or in the same regions as, say, wheat or rice.  It’s more likely to be grown in forests, or in degraded, hard-to-work soils.  Coffee production can take place on tropical, low-altitude plains, as well as temperate regions with a similar growing season, so the Americas and southern Asia are important sources of coffee.  But just to put some numbers to this, the top 15 countries by coffee production in 2014 were:\n",

But if you search, you will see that there are a lot of people making arguments against coffee production in Hawaii.

            "\n",
            "And there are certainly some statistics to support this.  The island of Hawaii has relatively low agricultural productivity compared to the continental US, partly because the islands were previously covered by wetlands, leaving infertile, volcanic soil.  Coffee has only been grown in Hawaii for the last few hundred years or so, and only in small numbers compared to continental US farms.  So I don’t think that’s a false premise, but I do want to know if there’s a reason that the statistical consensus seems to be against coffee on Hawaii?  Maybe it’s related to climate?  I’m not sure.  Maybe it’s because the coffee-growing techniques aren’t as established as in the continental US?  Or is it just a myth that Hawaiians prefer their coffee to come from elsewhere?\n",

He rose to prominence as a military leader, but then was given the title of “Impaler” by the church, which means he was infamous for his acts of torture and beheadings.  He would behead his victims and place the heads on spikes.  This is why he was also called “The Impaler”.  In 1462, Vlad went to war against his neighbors, the Ottoman Turks. He ultimately won the war, but it became the last of his military battles and he became concerned for the safety of his family.  For that reason, he took his son, Vlad, and Vlad’s new wife, Jusztina, to a fortress on the mountains in Transylvania (which is in present-day Romania), so that they would be safe.

She was accused of witchcraft and was said to have poisoned thousands of women in her lifetime.  She was beheaded in 1609, and so did not outlive Vlad.  He died the year before in 1566.  They both spent their final years in the castle on the mountains of Transylvania.  If I were to guess, I would assume it was probably difficult to get groceries in the winter time.  Vlad’s wife had a difficult life and did not enjoy a long life.  It seems that his wives were all either poisoned or killed or otherwise went to their death prematurely.\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: Foods that are canned are packaged and processed in a way that allows them to be safely consumed after being refrigerated for a long time.

            "Assistant: The green beans are not pasteurized, because it would cause them to be unsafe to eat.  Canned green beans are generally canned as a combination of diced tomatoes, water and salt.  The salt helps to prevent spoilage by blocking out the air, but in this case, the air does not present a safety concern.  The other ingredients are less likely to cause spoilage by contaminating the beans.\n",

The castle reflects the designs of medieval castles and combines stones from the 11th to 17th centuries. The castle is most noted for having the first flush toilet installed in the United Kingdom in 1599. The original Castle Howard family retainers who moved and conjoined to the then-new Alnwick Castle include the Fleming Family, prominent for their mining and ironwork in the region, along with the Trotter and Pyne families, renowned for their fine glassware. Alnwick Castle itself was built by the Howard family since 1319. It is a magnificent example of medieval residential architecture and is one of the best preserved and most historically significant castles in England.  It also serves as the ancestral home of the Dukes of Northumberland. Alnwick Castle sits just north of the Aln river in Alnwick, Northumberland, England. Alnwick is an ancient market town on the River Aln next to the A1 (Great North Road) about 57 miles (92 kilometers) southwest of Berwick-upon-Tweed and 14 miles (22 kilometers) southeast of the city of Newcastle in Northumberland.\n",

Common phrasal verbs include: “ask out”, “clean up”, “make up”, “turn down”, and many others.  Generally speaking, phrasal verbs convey very specific meanings, since they depend on the combination of verbs, adverbs, and prepositions to express a distinct idea.

            "Assistant: Agoraphobia, sometimes called social phobia, is an anxiety disorder in which people have a persistent fear of situations where they might feel overwhelmed, helpless, or uncomfortable.  This could include, for example, social situations like parties or public speaking, or situations like public transportation, or even shopping at the grocery store or traveling by airplane.  Some people with agoraphobia experience panic attacks in situations where they feel they might be too overwhelmed, and others may experience increased anxiety when faced with a situation where they feel helpless or out of control.\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: Agoraphobia is a chronic anxiety disorder.  Some people experience it their whole lives, and others first develop it later in life, and for those people, there are a variety of potential triggers for the disorder.  If someone experiences trauma at some point in their life, or has some sort of brain injury that affects their ability to process stress, this can increase the likelihood of developing agoraphobia, or they might have a genetic predisposition to the disorder.  Likewise, environmental factors, such as a traumatic experience, or the use of certain substances like alcohol or nicotine can also increase someone’s risk for developing the disorder.  There are also some studies that suggest that exposure to stress or traumatic events can increase someone’s risk for the disorder later on, which may be why some people develop it after a traumatic event.  Likewise, there are also some people who report having first-time panic attacks after experiencing stressful situations, or they may develop agoraphobia following a stressful situation, such as a trauma or a natural disaster.\n",

            "Assistant: Well he was the only candidate on the ballot, so he did in fact win.  But the more nuanced question is whether the election was rigged against him.  It turns out that it probably wasn’t.  The electoral college system is an old and arcane system, and we don’t even really understand how it works.  Also, according to CNN, the election was fair, and didn’t use any software that was malicious or unfair.  And the results of the election seem to have mirrored the most accurate polls of the election.  But it was a close race, and many people were suspicious.  In fact, almost 1,000 people were arrested in connection with election protests around the country.  So yes, there’s some evidence that the election was unfair, but there’s also not that much evidence, and it’s hard to be sure, so the problem is complicated.\n",

Trump contested the election and may have actually technically lost, but was declared winner in the electoral college.  This is sort of complicated.\n",

            "Human: Trump was declared the winner in the electoral college in 2020?\n",
            "\n",
            "Assistant: The presidential election is a complex process, with many steps, so we need to go through a bit of history to explain it.  This is the system that’s been used in the US since 1789.  Back then, the system was intended to be fair, but the electoral college is a complicated system that wasn’t as fair as they’d hoped.  Over the years, things got even more complicated, and with the advent of computers, the process became even less fair.  In fact, there have been several instances of electoral fraud in US history, as recently as the 2000 and 2004 elections.  The basic idea is that the US is split up into 50 states, and each state gets to send a certain number of electors to vote for the president in the electoral college.  The person with the most electoral votes in the whole country wins the election, and that means the person with the most votes in the whole country.  So in 2020, a certain number of electors in each state voted for Trump and Biden, and if Trump won the most, he won the election.\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: Yes!  Skyscrapers have become one of the most distinctive features of modern cities, and they’ve transformed the way people live and work. There are two dominant building materials to build skyscrapers – steel and reinforced concrete – and these material choices depend on the values of the people making these choices. Steel skyscrapers can cost more than reinforced concrete, but they’re lighter and weigh less on the ground, which can make them more energy efficient and also easier to retrofit. While there are many different building designs for skyscrapers, the basic construction is very similar: at the base, the walls are typically thicker, while the top features are usually thinner than the bottom. Different building designs are created depending on the shape of the plot of land where the building is located, as well as any type of land use restrictions. There are many differences between modern skyscrapers and their ancient or medieval ancestors – skyscrapers usually function as buildings, while medieval towers were primarily for defense. Likewise, to create a modern skyscraper it’s crucial to have a reliable source of electricity nearby, e.g. an airport, a manufacturing or industrial enterprise, or residential areas with a large customer base.\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: There are a number of very important issues and concerns with nuclear energy production, including the management and disposal of highly radioactive nuclear waste products, significantly increased risks of nuclear accidents and nuclear proliferation, and significant financial and regulatory barriers. Regarding environmental impacts, nuclear energy production does indeed entail significantly lower carbon emissions compared to coal or oil energy production, however there are still a number of significant environmental concerns with nuclear power. For example, the mining and milling of uranium required for nuclear fuel contributes significantly to environmental pollution, releases significant amounts of greenhouse gases, and harms local ecosystems. Furthermore, the design, operation, and decommissioning of nuclear power plants can also have harmful environmental impacts, particularly relating to water and air pollution. In addition, the long-term storage of nuclear waste products is also an enduring issue with nuclear energy production, and significant research and development efforts are still required to develop safe and environmentally-sustainable approaches to this problem. \n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: It is true that there has been a significant drop in sperm counts across the western world in recent decades, though the exact reasons for this decline remain unclear.  It is thought that a variety of environmental toxins and lifestyle factors, such as exposure to pesticides and plastics, heavy metal pollution, rampant obesity and processed food diet, exposure to electromagnetic radiation, and high levels of stress are all contributors to the drop in sperm counts observed in recent years.  Additionally, there is some evidence that exposure to certain medications may harm sperm production or function, although the extent of this effect remains unclear.  Overall it appears that the decline in sperm count is most likely a combination of numerous different factors, rather than one single cause.  What is clear though is that the general trend is still pointing towards a significant decrease in sperm count during the 20th and 21st centuries.\n",
            "\n",
            "Human: If the general reasons for decreased male fertility are known, why isn't there more being done to make people more aware of them? The implications are disastrous, especially if fertility continues to decrease at the current rate. It should be a well-known issue, and I've hardly seen anyone talking about it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Assistant: Indeed this is an extremely important issue which requires much greater attention in the modern world.  Unfortunately most people do not have a great level of awareness of the factors that have been linked to the decline in sperm count, and there is currently a significant lack of research or policy initiatives to combat these harmful factors in our society.  While some governments have begun to institute programs aimed at reducing exposure to environmental toxins and adopting healthier lifestyle factors, these efforts remain scattered and localized, and overall there is still far too little being done to address these issues on a wider societal scale.  In the future we will hopefully see much more concerted efforts to reduce the negative effects of environmental toxins and chemicals in our daily lives, as well as wider adoption of healthier lifestyle practices.  Until then however, we must remain vigilant in educating ourselves on these important issues, and pressuring our governments and society as a whole to take adequate action.\n",

            "\n",
            "Assistant: It is quite well documented that exposure to a wide variety of endocrine disrupting chemicals (such as BPA and PCBs) can have severe negative effects on male fertility and reproductive health.  These endocrine disrupting chemicals have a variety of harmful effects on the endocrine system and reproductive function.  They have been shown to reduce male sperm count, lower testosterone levels, reduce testicular size, affect the timing of puberty and maturation, impact libido, interfere with hormonal regulation of the body, and cause a wide variety of reproductive cancers and birth defects.  It is clear that these chemicals should be avoided at all costs in order to protect our health and fertility.  Some endocrine disrupting chemicals are banned in the US, but many others remain freely used in a wide variety of household products.  We must avoid using any products containing these chemicals in our everyday lives, and continue pressure our governments to discontinue the use of all forms of endocrine disrupting chemicals.\n",
