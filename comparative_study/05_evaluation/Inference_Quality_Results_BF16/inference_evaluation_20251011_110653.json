This involves using software to guess passwords, trying millions of combinations until the correct one is found. This method can be slow and time-consuming, but it can be very effective if the hacker has access to a large database of passwords or knows the victim's password history.\n\nTo protect your email account from hacking, it's important to use strong, unique passwords and",
