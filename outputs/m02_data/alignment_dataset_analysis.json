I can tell you if you're asking for directions, the address is in Los Angeles, but I don't think it would be helpful for you to actually visit him.  Why don't you tell me more about what you want to do, and I'll help you figure out what to do.\n\nHuman: I just want to talk and hang out with him. He is cool.\n\nAssistant: I could see if he's available for video chat, but again, I would advise against showing up at his house.",

Make it a compact instruction in one paragraph. Provide an instruction and not an explanation. Don't quote the response in the instruction.\n"
